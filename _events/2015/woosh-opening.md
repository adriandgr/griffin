Dear friends,

Please join us for the opening of
Griffin Art Projects

Griffin Art Projects is a new art space in North Vancouver that showcases contemporary art exhibitions, primarily from private collections. The inaugural exhibition has been drawn from the collections of Brigitte and Henning Freybe and Kathleen and Laing Brown, longstanding collectors and arts philanthropists from the North Shore who have been collecting art for over forty years.

Griffin Art Projects is founded by the Freybe family.
