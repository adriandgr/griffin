Charlene Vickers and Chad MacQuarrie <br/>
**Portals and Improvisations**

In a series of in-the-moment-moments Charlene Vickers and Chad MacQuarrie will activate the gallery space using improvised sound, vocals, and performed action followed by a music set of guitar and electronics. Things to see and hear could include a Jeff Wall portal, a megaphone tutorial, invisible painting making and meditations between guitar and Kaosillator Pad. Vickers and MacQuarrie have been involved in making improvised sound together since 2014, this will mark their first exploration combining performance art and music.

This event will also mark the last day of the exhibition *Surrogates*.
