From Two North Shore Collections

The inaugural exhibition has been drawn from the art collections of Brigitte and Henning Freybe and Kathleen and Laing Brown, longstanding collectors and arts philanthropists from the North Shore who have been collecting art for over forty years. Curated by Helga Pakasaar, the exhibition, entitled WOOSH: From Two North Shore Collections, brings together a breadth of contemporary art that reveals the international scope of their interests and ongoing support of local artists. Important early works by Vancouver artists Liz Magor, Steven Shearer, Ron Terada and Ian Wallace are in dialogue with such notable international artists as Pier Paolo Calzolari, John McCracken and Santiago Sierra. Crossing various mediums, the artworks literally and figuratively spill into the viewerâ€™s space. The exhibition foreground the social presence of such encounters. Often retooling industrial materials and common objects, the artists stage social and existential realities through poetic means.
